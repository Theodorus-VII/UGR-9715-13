            <p class="description">Super Mario Odyssey is a 2017 platform game developed and published by Nintendo
                for the Nintendo Switch. An entry in the Super Mario series, it follows Mario and his new ally Cappy—a
                sentient hat that allows Mario to control other characters and objects—as they journey across various
                kingdoms to save Princess Peach from his nemesis Bowser's plans of forced marriage. In contrast to the
                linear gameplay of prior entries, the game returns to the primarily open-ended, 3D platform gameplay
                featured in Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine.</p>

            <p class="description"> God of War is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and
                published by Sony Interactive Entertainment. It was released for the PlayStation 4 in April 2018, with a
                Windows port in January 2022. The game is the eighth installment in the God of War series, the eighth
                chronologically, and the sequel to 2010's God of War III. Unlike previous games, which were loosely
                based on Greek mythology, this installment is loosely inspired by Norse mythology, with the majority of
                it set in ancient Scandinavia in the realm of Midgard. For the first time in the series, there are two
                protagonists: Kratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only playable character, and his young
                son, Atreus. Following the death of Kratos's second wife Faye—Atreus' mother—the two embark on a journey
                to fulfill her request that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms. Kratos keeps his
                troubled past a secret from Atreus, who is unaware of his divine nature. Along their journey, they come
                into conflict with monsters and gods of the Norse world.
