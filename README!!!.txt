videos using iframes because github has a 25mb limit

**implementation with <video> tag still in files but COMMENTED**

search implementation requires js. and backend so not fully completed

UPDATE: JS portion is complete. the search page can carry over search querys in the site parameters, but
actual searching still requires backend work

individual games(god of war, persona, mario) are instances of POST from the wireframe and site diagram.


mario has been repeated 4 times in the slider to showcase the slider, due to lack of individual content pages.
